  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <hr>
  <div class="topText">
    <div id="topTop">
      <p1>Hi, I’m Khristian Thompson UX/UI designer, programmer,
     and cyber operations technician. You may be thinking wow
      that's broad and it most definitely is, but I owe it 
      all to my experiences and job status within the Air Force.
       I am from a small town in Alabama where one day I 
       decided I wanted to see the world and joined the military
        where I found myself surrounded by information technology.
         The endless training and broad spectrum experiences 
         opened my eyes to the avenues within this field where 
         I adopted my passion for I.T. 
      </p1>

    <div id="topBottom">
      <p2>One day, an opportunity came across my email to partake in 
      a UX/UI bootcamp at the University of Utah at the militaries 
      expense. I jumped on that opportunity without hesitation and 
      spent the next 6 months developing an understanding of UX/UI 
      concepts where I then became an abled Jr. UX/UI designer. Four 
      projects later and some experience in different facets I have 
      now developed a great understanding of the many pillars of UX/UI.

  <h1>MY SKILLS</h1>
  <hr>
  <div class="bottomText">
    <div id=bottomTop>
    <p3><span class="bold">USER RESEARCH:</span>  I possess exceptional user research skills 
      that empower me to uncover deep insights and create delightful 
      user experiences. With a meticulous approach, I conduct thorough
      interviews, employing effective questioning techniques to 
      understand user needs, behaviors, and motivations. By keenly 
      observing user interactions and identifying pain points, I 
      efficiently identify underlying problems to be addressed.
    </p3>

  <br>
  <div id=bottomMid>
    <p4><span class="bold">WEB DEVELOPMENT:</span> I am a skilled web developer with expertise
      in front-end and back-end technologies. I possess strong 
      proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design 
      principles, enabling me to create visually appealing and 
      user-friendly websites.
    </p4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id=bottomBottom>
    <p5><span class="bold">DESIGN IDEATION:</span> I excel in the art of design ideation, 
        transforming abstract concepts into innovative and meaningful
       solutions. I possess a unique ability to think outside the 
      box and generate fresh ideas that push boundaries while aligning
      with the client's objectives. Utilizing various ideation 
      techniques such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and sketching,
       I foster a creative and collaborative environment to explore
        multiple design possibilities. I have a keen eye for identifying
         user needs, pain points, and desires, which allows me to 
         create user-centric solutions that resonate with the target
          audience.
